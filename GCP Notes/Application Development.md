# Application Development

Can use various GCP services to run applictions

- Computational Resources
    1. Compute Engine â€” VM in the cloud
    2. K8s
    3. App Engine
        1. Standard (limited language runtimes)
        2. Flexible (use whatever language runtime you want)
    4. Cloud Functions

## Data Storage

[Google Course notes on Data Storage Options](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/gcpdev/1.2/Student/(online)%2003_Data%20Storage%20Options.pdf)

Secure data connections

Easier on Gen 2

Storage Options

1. Cloud Storage
    - Unstructured blob
    - Unique ID (URI)
2. Cloud Datastore
    - NoSQL
    - Some structure Key-Value store
    - Reliability and performance
    - Do not use for analytics
3. Cloud Firestore
    - Real Time FB
        - No SQL
        - More structured,  hierarchical
    - Cloud Storage for Firestore
4. Cloud Bigtable
    - No SQL
    - Highly scalable
    - Sparse
    - Use for analytics
    - Supports Hbase API
5. Cloud SQL
    - standard SQL using MySQL or PostgresQL
    - Fully managed
        - Replication
        - Failover
        - Backups
    - 2nd Gen version does not require whitelisting because of proxy
6. Spanner
    - SQL
    - Very scalable
    - Very redundant multi regional
    - Careful
        - Don't use incementing keys
7. BigQuery

    Large scale data warehouse for analytics

8. Cloud Filestore

    For applications that require a filesystem interface and a shared filesystem for data. Filestore gives users a simple, native experience for standing up managed Network Attached Storage (NAS) with their Google Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine instances

## Deployment Manager

c.f. Ansible, cheif,...

Infra as code ==> parameterised templates. 

Templates can be dynamic (Python and Jinja)
